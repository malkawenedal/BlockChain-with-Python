### step 1: Import Ethereum Transaction Functions into the Fintech Finder Application

in this section, we will import several functions from the crypto_wallet.py script into the file fintech_finder.py, which contains code for Fintech Finder’s customer interface,in order to add wallet operations to the application. 


### Step 2: Sign and Execute a Payment Transaction
we'll write the code that will calculate a fintech professional’s wage, in ether, based on the worker’s hourly rate and the number of hours that they work for a customer

### Step 3: Inspect the Transaction

we will send a test transaction by using the application’s web interface, and then look up the resulting transaction in Ganache
